Hi there! I'm Bryan, I have a Bachelors of Mathematics from the University of Waterloo majoring in statistics and computational mathematics. This site will host some of my personal projects, hobbies, and ideas.

A Little About Myself
------
My interests lie mostly within the applications of statistics and other computational mathematics theories in the real world (such as using differential equations to model cell populations and applying machine learning techniques to obtain predictive/inference models for given datasets). However, I am always open to learn more! Currently, I have a few ongoing projects (including this website as it will continue to be expanded on) that can be found on my [`GitHub`](https://github.com/bryanzang). On the other hand, completed projects can also be found under the [`Portfolio`](https://bryanzang.github.io/portfolio/) page. In addition, I have been reading [`Causal Inference: What If`](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/%20causal-inference-book/) by Hernan and Robins to learn more about causal inference and its relation to survival analysis and other biostatistics concepts. As important and interesting learning can be, a good balance with nature is also something I strive for, so in my free time I enjoy hiking and photography. More about my photography can be found under my [`blogs`](https://bryanzang.github.io/year-archive/).

What I have Planned
------
I hope to learn more about SQL and databases and as well as cloud services, so once I'm done the current projects, I will most likely start a few projects on these concepts (dealing with probably `SQL`, `MonogoDB`, `AWS`, and/or `Azure`).
