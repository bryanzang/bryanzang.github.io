## Overview
Hi there! I'm Bryan, I have a Bachelor of Mathematics from the University of Waterloo majoring in statistics and computational mathematics. This site will host some of my personal projects, hobbies, and ideas.

### A Little About Myself
My interests lie mostly within the applications of statistics and computational methods to real-world datasets. I love understanding and transforming data in the search for interesting results. But despite my focus on data modelling and statistical analyses, I enjoy also exploring a miscellaneous assortment of other topics, such as finance, economics, biology, philosophy, and likely more. Now when these areas of knowledge start to entwine and expand off of one another, is when my interest peaks --- being able to see the connection within the complex network of concepts is what I truly enjoy in the process of learning. In addition to academic and professional advances, I believe a good balance with nature is also something to strive for, so in my free time I enjoy hiking and outdoor photography.
