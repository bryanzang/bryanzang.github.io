Finding the cure to cancer is an exaggerated metaphor that has been used to imply how difficult and important a task is. With no doubt this is indeed the case, but this is not to say the task is impossible --- at the very least, researchers have been able to study and observe (1) the behavior of cancerous cells in response to various treatments and (2) the human body's natural response to cancer. We further look into the latter idea through the lens of an existing mathematical model [`[1]`](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6579737/) and propose a novel extension for which we investigate further upon this extended model's behavior.

## Project Description

- project should involve (i) identifying a published mathematical model, summarizing the system, the model, and the model analysis; (ii) implementing the model computationally, and (iii) extending the model or the analysis in a novel direction and interpreting your findings.
- report format: The final written report should include: (i) an abstract, (ii) an intro- duction, describing the biological system, and explaining why mathematical modelling is useful in this case, and what question(s) the model has been built to address; (iii) sections describing the biological system, the published model, and any published model analysis; (iv) a section describing your own implementation of the model (code can be included, but only as a supplementary appendix); (v) a section describing your novel model extensions or analysis; and (vi) a conclusion, summarizing your findings.
- the major research question should be identified. (Why is this work begin done?) Summarize the main points of the work being considered and comment on its strengths and weaknesses. Motivate your own novel extension of the work. Interpret the results of your analysis. Conclude by placing these specific results in a broader context.
